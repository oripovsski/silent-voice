      <div class="section-title">Why “Silent Voice”?</div>
      <p>Sometimes there’s a storm inside, but on the outside — silence. We’re not always ready to talk about what hurts. That’s why we named this space Silent Voice — it represents the quiet cry for help that still deserves to be heard.<br>Here, you can share your thoughts, emotions, and struggles — anonymously, safely, and without fear of judgment.</p>
